Write Semantic HTML\nUsing semantic HTML elements like <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer> makes your code more readable and improves accessibility.\n\n## 2. Follow CSS Naming Conventions\nAdopt a consistent naming convention like BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) to create more maintainable CSS code.\n\n## 3. Optimize Performance\nMinimize HTTP requests, compress images, and use lazy loading to improve page load times.\n\n## 4. Ensure Accessibility\nMake your website accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, by following WCAG guidelines."
